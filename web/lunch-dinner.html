	<p>   With locations in both Toronto and Richmond Hill, this gem of a restaurant knows exactly what it's doing when it comes to Thai cuisine. From authentic appetizers to curries to noodles to rice, there is truly something for everyone in the family. Items like their spring rolls, warm soups, and refreshing salads are a great way to kick the meal off, but the true magic is in the main dishes. Favourites like their red curry, mango chicken, and basil tofu offer an incredible punch of flavour. For all the carb lovers out there, there is also an assortment of rice and noodle options, such as their basil chili noodles and pineapple fried rice.  </p>

		<p>Kamasutra, located in midtown Toronto, boasts some of the best Indian food the city has to offer. Now, this is one spot where you simply cannot skip the appetizers. Their paneer tikka melts in your mouth, while the cauliflower tandoori offers a burst of flavour. Your best bet is to get the tandoori sampler, so you can indulge in a variety of the appetizers they have to offer. The main courses certainly do not disappoint either. Favourites including the butter chicken, saag (spinach) lamb, and malai kofta (cottage cheese balls in a cashew nut sauce). If you want to save money and enjoy various items, we suggest going for one of the mixed thali dinners, which give you the option to mix and match different appetizers and mains. </p>

		<p>Costa Sorrento knows how to do Italian food, and they know how to do it well. With high quality ingredients and experienced chefs, you can expect a high level of quality from this Markham restaurant. The pastas are delicious and authentic, with the gnocchi in particular being light and fluffy. There is also a selection of mains for those who prefer a more protein centered meal. However, the real star of the show at Costa Sorrento is the pizza. Made the traditional Neopolitan way, these thin-crust pizzas absolutely melt in your mouth. The margherita is a classic option which never fails to deliver, while the diavola is another must-try. To end your night on the sweetest possible note, be sure to order one of their gelatos. While they may be on the pricier side, we promise your taste buds will thank you for it. </p>

		<p>If you're looking for some incredible vegetarian food, look no further than Bo Tree Plant Based Cuisine. Located in Markham, they have an extensive list of options which will satisfy vegetarians and omnivores alike. Starting with appetizers here is a must, and while you'll love them all, we highly recommend you try the zingy buffalo cauliflower wings. For those looking for a healthier option, there are several exotic salads. But, it may be hard to resist going for one of their flatbreads, topped with gooey mozzarella and a generous portion of toppings. A household favourite is the forest pizza, containing sweet potatoes, wild mushrooms, and basil pesto. There are also a number of Asian options, like the chickenless katsu curry. Other amazing comfort foods include their pastas and sandwiches featuring imitation meat. </p>
