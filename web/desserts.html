	<p>The name of this delicious Vaughan bakery says it all- if you're looking for a pick me up, this place has all you'll need. They offer mouthwatering donuts and cupcakes, but are probably best known for the former. The donuts are fluffy and delicious, with a variety of flavours to choose from. There are some classics, such as the cinnamon sugar twist and apple fritter (you need to try this one, trust us). But, there are also some unique flavours which you won't find anywhere else. A personal favourite is the half-baked, a chocolate dip donut topped with freshly-baked brownies and edible cookie dough. The cookie monster donut, crossnut, and DunkABears conuts are other fan favourites. Their menu, which changes weekly, can be found on their online store. </p>

		<p>   Once you get a taste of the cookies at this Markham gem, few others will compare. They have a slight crunch on the outside and are decadent in the middle, loaded with high quality toppings. If you're a chocolate lover, the menage a trois contains a divine mix of dark, milk, and white chocolate chunks. For those with a sweeter tooth, the caramel and white chocolate cookies will surely deliver. And for any nut lovers, the honey pistachio and nutcracker are unique options you likely won't find elsewhere. To make the decision process easier, there is even a menu of cookie boxes by category to help you decide. Currently, all orders must be placed for pickup ahead of time. </p>

		<p>While we may not be able to roam the streets of Italy anytime soon, you can bring a taste of Italy home by ordering from this family-owned Scarborough bakery. Some of the favourites here include the bombes and bombolinis, donuts filled with nutella or pistachio custard. Their authentic cannolis, eclairs, and lobster tails will also melt in your mouth. They even have a selection of 12 different gelatos which can be enjoyed for days to come. However, what this spot is really known for is their pizza big slices. There are 14 different variations to choose from, including Nutella, s'mores, KitKat, red velvet, candy dream, and brownie. People say quality is better than quantity, but at Lamanna's you don't need to choose.</p>
