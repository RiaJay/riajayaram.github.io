	<p style="text-align:center;">It is impossible to deny that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on all our lives. It has put countless life milestones, </p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">family gatherings,  and personal goals on hold. And for many, it has resulted in extremely difficult financial situations. Among those  </p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">most affected are our community's small business owners, with restaurants being hit particularly hard. However, we can all do our</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;"> part by supporting them in a safe, delicious way. Numerous restaurants in Toronto are offering takeout and curbside pickup, allowing </p>
	<p style="text-align:center;"> us Torontonians to treat themselves to a variety of mouthwatering options. Here, you will find some of our favourite local spots by </p>
	<p style="text-align:center;"> category. So dive in and enjoy some delicious bites which will satisfy your cravings while giving back to our fellow Torontonians.</p>
